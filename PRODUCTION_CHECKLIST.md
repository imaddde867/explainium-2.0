./scripts/production_deploy.sh

# Verify health status
python scripts/health_check.py
```

### 2. Start Services
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Start application
python run_app.py
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check all services are running
python scripts/health_check.py --json

# Test file upload and processing
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/upload" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@test_document.pdf"
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Progress tracking not working:**
- Check if backend processing is enabled
- Verify API connectivity (port 8000)
- Check Celery worker status

**File upload fails:**
- Check file size limits
- Verify upload directory permissions
- Check available disk space

**Processing stuck:**
- Check Celery worker logs
- Verify Redis connectivity
- Check task queue status

**UI not loading:**
- Check Streamlit service status
- Verify port 8501 is available
- Check for JavaScript errors

### Health Monitoring
```bash
# Quick health check
python scripts/health_check.py

# Continuous monitoring
python scripts/health_check.py --monitor

# JSON output for automation
python scripts/health_check.py --json
```
