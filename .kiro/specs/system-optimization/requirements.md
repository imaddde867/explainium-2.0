# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Industrial Knowledge Extraction System currently has a solid foundation but needs optimization and cleanup to fully achieve its goal of extracting knowledge from industrial data sources, understanding it through AI processing, and storing it in a structured database for use by other AI agents. This spec focuses on system optimization, code cleanup, missing functionality implementation, and ensuring robust end-to-end processing capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to have proper startup and initialization procedures, so that all services start correctly and dependencies are properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Docker containers are started THEN the FastAPI application SHALL start with a proper command instead of "sleep infinity"
2. WHEN the application starts THEN database tables SHALL be automatically created if they don't exist
3. WHEN services start THEN proper health checks SHALL verify all dependencies (PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, Tika) are available
4. IF any critical service is unavailable THEN the application SHALL log appropriate error messages and retry connections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want missing AI processing modules to be implemented, so that the document processing pipeline can perform NER, classification, and keyphrase extraction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is processed THEN the NER extractor SHALL identify and extract named entities with confidence scores
2. WHEN a document is processed THEN the classifier SHALL categorize the document into predefined industrial categories
3. WHEN a document is processed THEN the keyphrase extractor SHALL identify relevant keyphrases for indexing
4. WHEN AI processing fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and continue with available data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the Celery worker to properly process uploaded documents, so that files are analyzed and their data is stored in the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN a Celery task SHALL be created and queued for processing
2. WHEN the Celery worker processes a document THEN extracted data SHALL be stored in PostgreSQL with proper relationships
3. WHEN document processing completes THEN the document status SHALL be updated to "processed"
4. WHEN processing fails THEN the document status SHALL be updated to "failed" with error details
5. WHEN structured data is extracted THEN equipment, procedures, safety info, technical specs, and personnel SHALL be stored in their respective tables

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the Elasticsearch integration to be fully functional, so that processed documents can be searched efficiently by other AI agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is processed THEN its content and metadata SHALL be indexed in Elasticsearch
2. WHEN search queries are made THEN results SHALL be returned with relevance scoring
3. WHEN documents are updated THEN their Elasticsearch index SHALL be updated accordingly
4. WHEN Elasticsearch is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue processing but log indexing failures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want proper CRUD operations implemented, so that the system can efficiently manage document data and relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are stored THEN all related entities SHALL be properly linked via foreign keys
2. WHEN data is retrieved THEN proper pagination and filtering SHALL be available
3. WHEN data is updated THEN referential integrity SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN data is deleted THEN cascading deletes SHALL handle related records appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that issues can be diagnosed and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN detailed logs SHALL be written with appropriate log levels
2. WHEN processing fails THEN error details SHALL be stored in the database for troubleshooting
3. WHEN API requests fail THEN proper HTTP status codes and error messages SHALL be returned
4. WHEN background tasks fail THEN retry mechanisms SHALL attempt reprocessing with exponential backoff

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing coverage, so that the system reliability can be verified and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN unit tests SHALL cover core processing functions
2. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN integration tests SHALL verify request/response handling
3. WHEN database operations are performed THEN tests SHALL verify data integrity
4. WHEN AI processing occurs THEN tests SHALL verify extraction accuracy with sample documents

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the codebase to follow consistent patterns and best practices, so that the system is maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow the established naming conventions and structure patterns
2. WHEN modules are created THEN they SHALL have proper separation of concerns
3. WHEN dependencies are added THEN they SHALL be properly managed in requirements files
4. WHEN configuration is needed THEN it SHALL use environment variables or configuration files appropriately

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As an AI agent developer, I want well-documented APIs and data schemas, so that I can integrate with the knowledge extraction system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are available THEN they SHALL have proper OpenAPI documentation
2. WHEN data is stored THEN database schemas SHALL be clearly defined and documented
3. WHEN responses are returned THEN they SHALL follow consistent JSON structure patterns
4. WHEN errors occur THEN error responses SHALL provide actionable information for debugging
