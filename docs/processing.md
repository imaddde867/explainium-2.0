# Document Processing Pipeline

## Overview

Multi-modal processing pipeline that transforms enterprise documents into structured knowledge with AI-powered extraction and relationship mapping.

## Processing Flow

```
Document Upload → Content Extraction → AI Analysis → 
Knowledge Structuring → Relationship Mapping → Graph Generation
```

## Stage 1: Content Extraction

### Multi-Modal Processing
- **Documents:** Apache Tika for PDF, DOCX, PPT, images with OCR
- **Videos:** FFmpeg audio extraction + OpenAI Whisper transcription
- **Images:** OCR text extraction and visual content analysis
- **Structured Data:** ERP/CMMS/QMS data parsing

### Technologies
```python
# Document processing
tika_response = requests.put(f"{TIKA_URL}/rmeta", data=file_content)

# Video processing
audio = ffmpeg.input(video_path).audio
whisper_model.transcribe(audio_path)

# Image processing
pytesseract.image_to_string(image)
```

## Stage 2: AI Analysis

### Named Entity Recognition
```python
# Extract entities (persons, organizations, equipment)
ner_model = "dslim/bert-base-NER"
entities = ner_pipeline(extracted_text)
```

### Content Classification
```python
# Categorize documents
classifier = "facebook/bart-large-mnli"
categories = ["Operational", "Safety", "Equipment", "Quality"]
classification = classifier(text, categories)
```

### Key Phrase Extraction
```python
# Extract important phrases
from keybert import KeyBERT
kw_model = KeyBERT()
keywords = kw_model.extract_keywords(text, keyphrase_ngram_range=(1, 3))
```

## Stage 3: Knowledge Structuring

### Tacit Knowledge Detection
```python
# Identify implicit knowledge patterns
tacit_detector = TacitKnowledgeDetector()
patterns = tacit_detector.detect_patterns(content)

# Extract decision trees
decision_extractor = DecisionTreeExtractor()
decisions = decision_extractor.extract_patterns(content)
```

### Structured Data Extraction
```python
# Equipment data
equipment_pattern = r'\b(?:pump|motor|valve|sensor)\b.*?(?:specifications|model|type)'
equipment_data = extract_structured_data(text, equipment_pattern)

# Procedures
procedure_pattern = r'\b(?:step|procedure|process)\s*\d+[:\.]?\s*(.+?)(?=\n|$)'
procedures = extract_procedures(text, procedure_pattern)

# Safety information
safety_pattern = r'\b(?:warning|caution|danger|hazard)\b[:\s]*(.+?)(?=\n|$)'
safety_info = extract_safety_data(text, safety_pattern)
```

## Stage 4: Relationship Mapping

### Process Dependencies
```python
# Map process relationships
dependency_mapper = ProcessDependencyMapper()
dependencies = dependency_mapper.identify_dependencies(knowledge_items)

# Types: prerequisite, parallel, downstream, conditional
```

### Equipment-Maintenance Correlation
```python
# Link equipment to maintenance patterns
correlator = EquipmentMaintenanceCorrelator()
correlations = correlator.correlate_maintenance(equipment, procedures)

# Types: preventive, corrective, predictive
```

### Skill-Function Mapping
```python
# Map skills to job functions
skill_linker = SkillFunctionLinker()
links = skill_linker.link_skills(personnel, procedures)

# Proficiency: basic, intermediate, advanced, expert
```

### Compliance Connections
```python
# Connect regulations to procedures
compliance_connector = ComplianceProcedureConnector()
connections = compliance_connector.connect_compliance(procedures, safety_info)

# Regulations: OSHA, EPA, ISO, FDA
```

## Stage 5: Knowledge Graph Generation

### Graph Construction
```python
# Build comprehensive knowledge graph
graph_builder = KnowledgeGraphBuilder()
graph = graph_builder.build_graph(
    knowledge_items=items,
    dependencies=dependencies,
    correlations=correlations,
    skill_links=links,
    compliance_connections=connections
)
```

### Graph Analytics
```python
# Analyze relationships
traversal_engine = GraphTraversalEngine(graph)
analysis = traversal_engine.analyze_dependencies()

# Results: critical paths, bottlenecks, circular dependencies
```

## Asynchronous Processing

### Celery Task Queue
```python
@celery.task
def process_document_task(file_path):
    # Stage 1: Extract content
    content = extract_content(file_path)
    
    # Stage 2: AI analysis
    entities = extract_entities(content)
    classification = classify_content(content)
    
    # Stage 3: Structure knowledge
    knowledge_items = structure_knowledge(content, entities)
    
    # Stage 4: Map relationships
    relationships = map_relationships(knowledge_items)
    
    # Stage 5: Generate graph
    graph = generate_knowledge_graph(knowledge_items, relationships)
    
    # Store results
    store_in_database(knowledge_items, relationships, graph)
    index_in_elasticsearch(content, knowledge_items)
```

### Task Monitoring
```python
# Check task status
task_result = AsyncResult(task_id)
status = task_result.status  # PENDING, SUCCESS, FAILURE

# Get task progress
progress = task_result.info
```

## Quality Assurance

### Confidence Scoring
```python
# Multi-factor confidence calculation
def calculate_confidence(extraction_score, pattern_match, context_relevance):
    base_confidence = extraction_score * 0.4
    pattern_boost = pattern_match * 0.3
    context_boost = context_relevance * 0.3
    return min(1.0, base_confidence + pattern_boost + context_boost)
```

### Evidence Tracking
```python
# Track extraction evidence
evidence = {
    "pattern_matches": ["safety check required before startup"],
    "entity_mentions": ["safety inspection", "equipment startup"],
    "confidence_factors": ["direct_mention", "pattern_match", "context_relevance"]
}
```

### Validation Pipeline
```python
# Validate extracted relationships
def validate_relationship(source, target, relationship_type, evidence):
    # Check for circular dependencies
    # Validate confidence thresholds
    # Ensure evidence quality
    # Cross-reference with existing knowledge
    return validation_result
```
