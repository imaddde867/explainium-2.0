# Explainium Performance Optimization Agent Prompt

## System Overview

You are tasked with optimizing the Explainium 2.0 document knowledge extraction platform to dramatically improve processing speed while maintaining high-quality results. The system currently takes ~10 minutes per document on an M4 16GB MacBook Pro, which is unacceptable for production use.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Performance Bottlenecks Identified:

1. **Sequential Processing**: LLM processing is synchronous and blocks the entire pipeline
2. **Inefficient Model Loading**: Models are loaded fresh for each document instead of being cached
3. **Over-Processing**: Multiple redundant extraction methods run sequentially instead of intelligently
4. **Memory Inefficiency**: Large models consume excessive RAM without proper memory management
5. **Blocking I/O**: File processing and database operations are synchronous
6. **Redundant Text Processing**: Content is processed multiple times by different engines
7. **Inefficient Prompt Strategy**: Multiple LLM calls instead of optimized single-pass extraction

### Current Processing Flow (SLOW):

```
Document → Content Extraction → LLM Engine → Enhanced Engine → Legacy Engine → Validation → Database
   ↓           ↓                    ↓             ↓               ↓            ↓          ↓
  ~10min     Takes far more time than the original estimates shown above
```

## Optimization Requirements

### Performance Targets:

- **Processing Time**: Reduce from 10 minutes to under 60 seconds per document
- **Memory Usage**: Keep under 8GB RAM during processing
- **Throughput**: Support batch processing of multiple documents
- **Quality**: Maintain confidence scores above 0.75
- **Reliability**: 95%+ success rate with graceful fallbacks

### Hardware Constraints:

- M4 MacBook Pro with 16GB RAM
- Metal GPU acceleration available
- 8-core CPU with efficient cores
- Local processing only (no external API calls)

## Specific Optimization Tasks

### 1. Model Loading & Caching Optimization

```python
# CURRENT PROBLEM: Models loaded fresh each time
class LLMProcessingEngine:
    async def _initialize_primary_llm(self):
        # Loads model every time - SLOW!
        self.llm_model = Llama(model_path=str(model_file), ...)

# OPTIMIZATION TARGET:
- Implement singleton pattern for model instances
- Use model pooling for concurrent processing
- Implement lazy loading with warmup
- Add model quantization optimization for M4
- Cache embeddings and intermediate results
```

### 2. Async Processing Pipeline

```python
# CURRENT PROBLEM: Sequential blocking operations
def process_document(self, file_path: str, document_id: int):
    content = self._process_text_document(file_path)  # BLOCKING
    knowledge = await self._llm_processing(content)   # BLOCKING
    result = self._validate_entities(knowledge)       # BLOCKING

# OPTIMIZATION TARGET:
- Convert entire pipeline to async/await
- Implement concurrent processing stages
- Use asyncio.gather() for parallel operations
- Stream processing for large documents
- Background task queues for non-critical operations
```

### 3. Smart Processing Strategy

```python
# CURRENT PROBLEM: Always runs all extraction methods
# LLM → Enhanced → Legacy (even when LLM succeeds)

# OPTIMIZATION TARGET:
- Implement confidence-based early termination
- Use document complexity assessment to choose optimal method
- Parallel processing with result merging
- Intelligent fallback only when needed
- Cache results to avoid reprocessing similar content
```

### 4. Memory Management

```python
# CURRENT PROBLEM: Memory leaks and inefficient usage
# Multiple models loaded simultaneously
# Large text chunks processed without chunking

# OPTIMIZATION TARGET:
- Implement proper memory cleanup
- Use text chunking for large documents
- Model swapping based on document type
- Garbage collection optimization
- Memory-mapped file processing
```

### 5. Optimized LLM Prompting

```python
# CURRENT PROBLEM: Multiple LLM calls per document
# 5 specialized prompts run sequentially

# OPTIMIZATION TARGET:
- Single comprehensive prompt with structured output
- Batch processing multiple documents
- Prompt caching and reuse
- Optimized context window usage
- Streaming responses for faster perceived performance
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Target: 50% speed improvement)

1. **Model Caching**: Implement singleton pattern for LLM models
2. **Async Conversion**: Convert file I/O and database operations to async
3. **Early Termination**: Stop processing when confidence threshold is met
4. **Memory Cleanup**: Add proper garbage collection and memory management

### Phase 2: Architecture Optimization (Target: 75% speed improvement)

1. **Parallel Processing**: Run extraction methods concurrently
2. **Smart Routing**: Choose optimal processing method based on document analysis
3. **Streaming**: Implement streaming for large documents
4. **Caching Layer**: Add Redis caching for processed results

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimization (Target: 85% speed improvement)

1. **Model Optimization**: Fine-tune models for specific document types
2. **Hardware Acceleration**: Optimize for M4 Metal GPU
3. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple documents simultaneously
4. **Predictive Loading**: Pre-load models based on document queue

## Code Optimization Examples

### Optimized Model Loading:

```python
class OptimizedLLMEngine:
    _model_cache = {}
    _model_lock = asyncio.Lock()

    @classmethod
    async def get_model(cls, model_path: str):
        if model_path not in cls._model_cache:
            async with cls._model_lock:
                if model_path not in cls._model_cache:
                    cls._model_cache[model_path] = await cls._load_model_optimized(model_path)
        return cls._model_cache[model_path]

    @staticmethod
    async def _load_model_optimized(model_path: str):
        # Optimized loading with M4 Metal acceleration
        return Llama(
            model_path=model_path,
            n_gpu_layers=-1,  # Use all Metal layers
            n_threads=4,      # Optimized for M4 efficiency cores
            n_batch=8,        # Larger batch for throughput
            use_mmap=True,    # Memory-mapped files
            use_mlock=True,   # Lock in memory
            verbose=False
        )
```

### Optimized Processing Pipeline:

```python
async def process_document_optimized(self, file_path: str, document_id: int):
    # Parallel content extraction and model loading
    content_task = asyncio.create_task(self._extract_content_async(file_path))
    model_task = asyncio.create_task(self._get_cached_model())

    content, model = await asyncio.gather(content_task, model_task)

    # Quick document assessment
    complexity = await self._assess_complexity_fast(content)

    # Choose optimal processing method
    if complexity < 0.3:
        return await self._fast_pattern_processing(content)
    elif complexity < 0.7:
        return await self._hybrid_processing(content, model)
    else:
        return await self._full_llm_processing(content, model)
```

### Optimized LLM Prompting:

````python
OPTIMIZED_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
Extract ALL knowledge from this document in a single pass. Return JSON with:
{
  "technical_specs": [{"item": "", "value": "", "unit": "", "confidence": 0.0}],

}

"""

async def extract_with_single_prompt(self, content: str, model):
    # Single LLM call instead of 5 separate calls
    response = await model.generate_async(
        OPTIMIZED_EXTRACTION_PROMPT.format(content=content),
        max_tokens=2048,
        temperature=0.1,
        stop_tokens=["```", "---"]
    )
    return self._parse_structured_response(response)
````
