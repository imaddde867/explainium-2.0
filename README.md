# EXPLAINIUM: Enterprise Knowledge Extraction System

## Overview

EXPLAINIUM is an advanced AI-powered system designed to extract, analyze, and structure tacit knowledge from enterprise and industrial environments. Building on our proven Industrial Knowledge Extraction System foundation, EXPLAINIUM transforms unstructured organizational knowledge into a comprehensive, queryable processes database that serves specialized AI agent networks.

The system processes diverse content types - from technical manuals and training videos to enterprise system data - and intelligently extracts hidden organizational expertise, workflow dependencies, and operational patterns. Built entirely with free and open-source technologies, EXPLAINIUM delivers enterprise-grade knowledge management capabilities.

## Setup and Running

### Quick Start (Local Development)

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/imaddde867/explainium-2.0
cd explainium-2.0
```

2. **Build and start Docker services:**
   Ensure Docker Desktop is running, then execute:
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```
   This will build all necessary Docker images and start the backend services (FastAPI, Celery, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Tika, Redis, and the new knowledge processing components).

3. **Run database migrations:**
   Initialize the enhanced database schema with knowledge-specific tables:
```bash
docker-compose exec app alembic upgrade head
```

4. **Start the React frontend:**
   Navigate to the frontend directory and start the development server:
```bash
cd src/frontend
npm install  # Install frontend dependencies (only needed once)
npm start
```
   The frontend application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` with the new knowledge management dashboard.

### Enterprise Deployment

For production enterprise deployment with high availability and scalability:

```bash
# Production deployment with knowledge processing clusters
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Initialize knowledge extraction workers
docker-compose exec knowledge-worker celery worker -A knowledge.tasks --loglevel=info
```
